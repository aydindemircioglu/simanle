## Resubmission

This is a resubmission in which I tried to 

- remove another memory bug. I am still sorry that i cannot reproduce the bugs locally. I asked on the R-package-devel mailing list on  how to set up the R/gcc/clang toolchain or docker to obtain the same results as on your server, but i did not get any answer. If this submit is buggy again, please pull it from cran until i find out how to reproduce the memory bugs. Again, sorry.
